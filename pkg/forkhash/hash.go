// HashReps allows the number of multiplication/division cycles to be repeated before the final hash, on release for

// DivHash first runs an arbitrary big number calculation involving a very large integer, and hashes the result. In this
// way, this hash requires both one of 9 arbitrary hash functions plus a big number long division operation and three
// multiplication operations, unlikely to be satisfied on anything other than CPU and GPU, with contrary advantages on
// each - GPU division is 32 bits wide operations, CPU is 64, but GPU hashes about equal to a CPU to varying degrees of
// memory hardness (and CPU cache size then improves CPU performance at some hashes)
//
// This hash generates very large random numbers from an 80 byte block using a procedure involving two squares of
// recombined spliced halves, multiplied together and then divided by the original block, reversed, repeated 4 more
// times, of over 48kb to represent the product, which is hashed afterwards. ( see example in fork/scratch/divhash.go )
//
// This would be around half of the available level 1 cache of a ryzen 5 1600, likely distributed as 6 using the 64kb
// and 3 threads using the 32kb smaller ones. Here is a block diagram of Zen architecture:
// https://en.wikichip.org/w/images/thumb/0/02/zen_block_diagram.svg/1178px-zen_block_diagram.svg.png This is one, with
// Zen the cores are independently partitioned. But it shows that it has one divider per core. Thus for a 6 core, 6
// would be the right number to use with it as other numbers will lead to contention and memory copies. Probably its
// ability to branch twice per cycle will be a big boost for its performance in this task.
//
// Long division units are expensive and slow, and make a perfect application specific proof of work because a
// substantial part of the cost as proportional to the relative surface area of circuitry it is substantially more than
// 10% of the total logic on a CPU. There is low chances of putting these units into one package with half half IDIV and
// IMUL units and enough cache for each one, would be economic or accessible to most chip manufacturers at a scale and
// clock that beats the CPU price.
//
// Most GPUs still only have 32 bit integer divide units because the type of mathematics done by GPUs is mainly based on
// multiplication, addition and subtraction, specifically, with matrixes, which are per-bit equivalent to big (128-512
// bit) addition, built for walking graphs and generating directional or particle effects, under gravity, and the like.
// Video is very parallelisable so generally speaking GPU's main bulk of processing capability does not help here,
// caches holding a fraction of the number at a time as it is computed, and only 32 bits wide at a time for the special
// purpose dividers, that are relatively swamped by stream processors in big grids.
//
// The cheaper arithmetic units can be programmed to also perform the calculations but they are going to be funny letter
// log differences to the point it adds up to less than 10% better due to complexity of the code and scheduling it.
//
// Long story short, this hash function should be the end of big margin ASIC mining, and a lot of R&D funds going to
// improving smaller fabs for spewing out such processors.
